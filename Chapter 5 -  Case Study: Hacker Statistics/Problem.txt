This Project will allow me to apply all the concepts I've learned in this course. I will use hacker statistics to calculate my chances of winning a bet.
I will use random number generators, loops, and Matplotlib to gain a competitive edge!

My friend and I are at the Empire State Building, and we are going to climb the
stairs. My climbing moves follows the following rules:

I throw a die 100 times.

If I throw one or two, I will go one step down,
if it's three, four or five, I will go one step up,
and If it's six, I throw the dice one more time and walk up the resulting number.
I cannot go below the number zero,
and there is a 0.1% chance of falling down the stairs and go back to number zero, and I have to start again.

I bet that with these rules in mind, I can reach 60 steps high. We want to calculate the chance
to win this bet, using simulation and Hacker Statistics.
